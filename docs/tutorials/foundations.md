# Foundational Elements

In this set of tutorials/walkthroughs, we go through the some of the core elements
and mechanisms underlying ngc-learn in order understand how its simulation
scheme (and the nodes-and-cables system) works and to help in writing your
own custom elements.

The foundational walkthroughs are organized as follows:
1. <b>[Using Model Contexts](../tutorials/foundations/contexts.md)</b>: This lesson goes 
   the fundamentals of the primary simulation construct you need to set up models, the 
   (simulation) context.
2. <b>[Understanding Commands](../tutorials/foundations/commands.md)</b>: This lesson will
   walk you through the basics of a command -- an essential part of building a
   simulation controller in ngc-learn and ngcsimlib -- and offer some useful
   points for designing new ones.
3. <b>[Operations](../tutorials/foundations/operations.md)</b>: Here, the basics
   of bundle rules, a commonly use mechanism for crafting complex biophysical
   systems, will be presented.
