# Lessons: Model and Simulation Basics

In this set of tutorials/lessons, we go through the basic use of ngc-learn
to construct basic functioning dynamical systems and simulating them.

The lessons are organized to be followed sequentially, though you may jump to
different points as is relevant:
1. <b>[Setting Up a JSON Experimental Configuration](../tutorials/model_basics/json_modules.md)</b>:
   In this lesson, you will learn how JSON configuration is used to rapidly
   allow you to import parts of ngc-learn relevant to the model that you want to build.
2. <b>[Crafting a Basic Model](../tutorials/model_basics/model_building.md)</b>: This
   lesson will walk you through a basic setup of a controller with a few components, the
   essence of a basic model or system that is simulated in ngc-learn.
3. <b>[Evolving a Synapse](../tutorials/model_basics/evolving_synapses.md)</b>: In this
   lesson, you will take your controller and configure its single synapse to
   evolve iteratively via a 2-factor Hebbian rule.
