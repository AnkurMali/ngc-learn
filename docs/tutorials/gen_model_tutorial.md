# Tutorial 1: Learning NGC Generative Models

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use NGC-Learn's model museum to fit an
NGC generative model to the MNIST dataset. Specifically, we will focus on
training three key models, each with different structural properties, and
estimating their marginal log likelihoods.
