# The Model Museum

There is an ever-growing galaxy of neurobiological models and credit assignment
processes [1, 2]. One of ngc-learn's aims, in the spirit of scientific
reproducibility, is to capture a snapshot of as many of these
biomimetic/neuro-mimetic models as possible, in the form of a digital "museum".
This museum is further designed with the notion of exhibits and exhibitors,
aiding to facilitate credit assignment and respectful citation to the ideas and
the work of those that have helped to lay the foundations for the progress
observed today. Recently, we have separated out the model museum into its own
particular maintained repository called
[ngc-museum](https://github.com/NACLab/ngc-museum), where you can find and
access/run historical models and agents built with ngc-learn to perform
different experimental tasks.

Please refer to the [table of contents](../museum/index.rst) for walkthroughs on
using and running various historical models in the museum.
