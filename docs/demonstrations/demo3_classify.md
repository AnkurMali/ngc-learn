# Demo 3: Creating an NGC Classifier

In this demonstration, we will learn how to create a classifier based on NGC.
After going through this demonstration, you will:

1.  Learn how to use a simple projection graph to initialize the settling process
of an NGC model.
2.  Craft and simulate a custom NGC model that can directly classify the image
patterns in the MNIST database (from Demonstration \# 1).

Note that the folder of interest to this demonstration is:
+ `examples/demo3/`: this contains the necessary simulation script
