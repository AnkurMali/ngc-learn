# Demo 5: Pattern Completion through Auto-Associative Recall

<i>NOTE: This demonstration is under construction and thus incomplete at the moment...</i>

 In this demonstration, we will see how to utilize a (pre-)trained NGC model
 and use to conduct auto-associative pattern completion.
 After going through this demonstration, you will:

 1.  Learn how to use the "mask" compartment of an `SNode` in an `NGCGraph`
 to allow for partial masking/clamping to trigger an NGC system's ability to
 perform auto-associative pattern recall.
