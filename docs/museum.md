# The Model Museum

One of ngc-learn's aims, in the spirit of scientific reproducibility, is to
capture a snapshot of as many of biomimetic/neuro-mimetic models as possible,
in the form of a digital "museum". This museum is further designed with the
notion of exhibits and exhibitors, aiding to facilitate credit assignment and
respectful citation to the ideas and the work of those that have helped to lay
the foundations for the progress observed today. Recently, we have separated
out the model museum into its own particular maintained repository called
`ngc-museum`, where you can find and access/run historical models and agents
built with ngc-learn to perform different experimental tasks.
