# ngclib: support library for ngc-learn

<b>ngc-lib</b> is the support library and central dependency for ngc-learn. 
While ngc-learn contains the JAX-implemented routines and any supporting C
code, ngc-lib is a pure Python package, primarily meant for providing the
machinery, routines, and utilities that facilitate the general (abstract)
simulation of complex adaptive systems made up of dynamical components. For
information, including anything related to usage instructions and details,
please refer to the ngc-learn README:
https://github.com/NACLab/ngc-learn/.

This sub-package is also distributed under the 3-Clause BSD license.
